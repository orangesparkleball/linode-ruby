Our goal is to create a collection of open source scripts to closely replicate
the ease of Heroku deployment, while giving users the power to install on their
own server. 


Planned initial features:
* Basic stackscript for Linode installation of basic tools (stack to be nginx/unicorn)
* RVM for gemsets
* Collection of scripts to allow easy bundle installs and whatnot
* Gitorious
